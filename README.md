## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  
This project uses the following packahes
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. ScikitLearn
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.8.

The data has not been attached to the project. Please download the US EPA dataset from Kaggle, link available in (https://www.kaggle.com/epa/fuel-economy?select=database.csv).
Store the 'database.csv' file in a folder called 'Data'.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I am interested in studying fuel economy of gasoline vehicles and for this project I am using the fuel economy dataset from US Environmental Protection Agency published in 2017. The information I am looking for are:

1. How does average fuel economy change over the years?
2. Which class of vehicles have the best fuel economy?
2. Does Automatic or Manual transmission have a better fuel economy?
3. Does premium gasoline contribute to better fuel economy?
4. Can we predict the mileage of a gasoline vehicle?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>


There is1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credit to US Environment Protection Agency for the data. The data is available in the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/epa/fuel-economy?select=database.csv).
